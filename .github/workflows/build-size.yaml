            ## 👋 Thanks for your contribution!

            Since this PR comes from a forked repository, build size check requires approval from a maintainer for security reasons.

            **Next steps:**
            1. A maintainer will review your code
            2. If approved, they'll add the `safe-to-build` label to trigger the build size check
            3. **After each new commit**, the maintainer will need to remove and re-add the label for security

            This ensures every version of the code is explicitly reviewed before running checks. Thank you for your patience! 🙏
