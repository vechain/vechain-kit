            ## 👋 Thanks for your contribution!

            Since this PR comes from a forked repository, the build size check will only run for internal PRs for security reasons.
            Please ensure that your PR is coming from a meaningful branch name. Eg. feature/my-feature **not main**

            A maintainer will review your changes and can manually verify the build size impact if needed.

            Thank you for your patience! 🙏
